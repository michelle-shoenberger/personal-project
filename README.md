# Budgeting App

## Purpose
All information will require a login, providing viewing and changing data associated with the user.

Users will be able to add expenses and view/change all in Expenses page

The home page will include a summary of expenses and compare them to a user designated budget for all categories.

## API's
Beyond the site database, the website will incorporate the option to put the cost of expenses in other currency.  Then the backend will call the Currency conversion api to convert to USD.  Everything will be stored and displayed in USD.

For a second API, I haven't found anything terribly pertinent.  The Noun API can be used to add a picture to expenses based off the name or category.
